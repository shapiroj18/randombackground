# Mac Terminal Color Changes

Created following [this](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/12/random-terminal-background-colors/) article!

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/shapiroj18/terminal_colors.git`
2. `cd terminal_colors`
3. `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`
4. `cd ..`
5. `rm -rf terminal_colors`

This adds the `color` command to your path so that you can run any time you are in the terminal (restart terminal to use the command).

### Notes
1. This has only works with Mac OS and ZSH
